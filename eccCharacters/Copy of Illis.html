                Organisation?: St Astrids Church, Norweigian government <br>
                Details: Came 1st in their class on modern swordfighting, their Tychokinesis lending 
                them an edge over other compeditors. Despite this, they do not like physical combat preferring 
                traditional negotiation methods instead. Married to Doctor Su-Ah Hallsder and working as a 
                Peacekeeper for the Norweigian Government alongside a small group of Abberants tasks with 
                conflict resolution. Often deployed alongside ambulance officials as their Telekinesis makes
                them of great assistance when moving injured patients. Spends much time assisting with running St 
                Astrids Church, a relativley new church with the philosophies of showing kindness to others and 
                standing strong in the face of hardship. Dreams of using their powers to help with greater, less
                stressful matters such as building repair or helping show younger Abberants how to use their powers 
                (for good causes).

                they moved out of the camp and into a small house on the outskirts of Oslo. After this both children
                and the father lived relativley normal lives with Ingrid becoming a waitress and Illis joining the Peace
                department. Illis and Ingrid both
